# Merge Sort vs Selection Sort Performance Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth performance analysis of Merge Sort and Selection Sort algorithms. The analysis compares the efficiency of both algorithms in terms of critical operations and execution time, as well as their data sensitivity through the coefficient of variance results. The study also investigates how the outcomes of the two algorithms compare to their theoretical time complexity (Big-O analysis).


### Prerequisites

- Java (JDK 11 or higher)
- Git (for cloning the repository)


## Results

The analysis reveals that Merge Sort consistently outperforms Selection Sort in terms of critical operations and execution time, particularly as the size of the data set increases. Merge Sort also displays superior stability and consistency in performance across diverse data sets.
